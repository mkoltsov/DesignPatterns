# DesignPatterns
It's a repo to practice writing various software design patterns

## 1. Creational patterns 
### - Singleton - Ensures one and only one object is created.
###	- Builder -  Encapsulates the creation of an object (letâ€™s call it a builder), and have our client ask the builder to construct the structure for it.  
###	- Prototype
###	- Abstract Factory - Allows a client to create families of objects without specifying their concrete classes.
###	- Factory Method - Subclasses decide which concrete classes to create.

## 2. Behavioral patterns
###	- Template method - Subclasses decide which concrete classes to create.
###	- Visitor
###	- Mediator
###	- Iterator - Provides a way to traverse a collection of objects without exposing its implementation.
###	- Command - Encapsulates a request as an object.
###	- Memento
###	- Observer - Allows objects to be notified when state changes.
###	- Interpeter
###	- Chain of Responsibility
###	- State - Encapsulates state-based behaviors and uses delegation to switch between behaviors.
###	- Strategy - Encapsulates interchangeable behaviors and uses delegation to decide which one to use.

## 3. Structural patterns 
###	- Decorator - Wraps an object to provide new behavior.
###	- Composite - Clients treat collections of objects and individual objects uniformly.
###	- Proxy - Wraps an object to control access to it.
###	- Facade - Simplifies the interface of a set of classes.
###	- Bridge - 	The Bridge Pattern allows you to vary the implementation and the abstraction by placing the two in separate class hierarchies.
###	- Flyweight
###	- Adapter - Wraps an object and provides a different interface to it.
